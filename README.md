# InstAgenda

An App that helps / provides a way for people who have a hard time keeping a schedule, or who may have an attention deficit disorder, who want to manage important life events by providing information about themselves and receiving a schedule w/ alerts to keep them on task and on time.

## Story
As a student at the Apple Developer Academy, Detroit; during our time in the academy we were allowed to take place in the "Swift Student Challenge" where we were individually able to show off our proficiency in SwiftUI inside of a playground page. Upon conclusion of the challenge I continued to build out the application that I was submitted.

"InstAgenda" is an attention deficit - friendly, Caldendar alternative, app that allows users to create, edit, and manage important events in their life. This project is important to me as an idividual who has adhd themselves and find it sometimes troubling to manage a multitude of events in a schedule. Its my hope that this application finds its way to the millions of people who suffer from attention deficit disorders (15.5 million in the US alone).

## Lessons Learned

What did you learn while building this project? What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?

InstAgenda is probably my most challenging project thus far and so far I have learned a lot in the creation of this application.

I've learned how to use @Model types to assign variables to events as well as pass the infromation input by the user around the app.
